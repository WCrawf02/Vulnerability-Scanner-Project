# Vulnerability Scanner ðŸ’» ðŸ”¬

This repository contains a Python script for a simple vulnerability scanner that analyzes web pages for potential security vulnerabilities. This school project scanner utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup from bs4 to parse HTML responses. It checks for common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and sensitive information exposure.

### âœ¨ Key Features âœ¨:

- Sends HTTP requests to specified URLs and analyzes HTML responses for vulnerabilities.
- Checks for XSS vulnerabilities by inspecting input fields, script tags, and other potential attack vectors.
- Identifies potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by examining error messages or other indicators in the HTML response.
- Detects sensitive information exposure, such as passwords or other confidential data, in the HTML content.

### ðŸ§­ Usage:

- Install Python and the required libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup).
- Run the vulnerability_scanner.py script, passing the URL of the web page you want to scan as an argument.
- The scanner will analyze the specified URL for potential vulnerabilities and provide output indicating any findings.
- Feel free to use and modify this vulnerability scanner for your own projects or security testing purposes. Contributions and feedback are welcome! :rocket:
